3. If you have Magica Cloth 2, you can use External/UnityChan/Prefabs/UnityChan_Pro to perform for better visual effects

## 【How to play MMD】
1. Enter the game Data directory (Assets folder in Editor)
2. Place the .vmd file and .wav audio in the recorded VMD folder
3. The configuration table is the UserConfig.json file in this directory
4. Modify the relative path of AudioPath and VMDPath
```json
{
     "AudioPath": "CHUNG HA - Snapping.wav",
     "VMDPath": "Snapping.vmd"
}
```
5. Start the game

## 【Description of Morph】
Since UnityChan's BlendShape does not conform to the MMD name specification, the project uses the MorphBlendShape function for mapping. If you use other characters that do not have this name specification problem, you can uncheck ```Use Morph BlendShape```
